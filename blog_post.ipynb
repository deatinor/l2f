    "An acoustic impulse response (AIR) is a response of a certain environment to a Dirac sound as the input signal. AIR consists out of direct sound and numerous echoes that reach the sensor when the sound reflects on the walls. Reflections of walls are modeled with a so-called *image-source model*, which are located at the mirrored positions of the real source against the wall. Higher order virutal sources are determined recursively. Each image-source models the propagation delay of the arrival of an echo.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we see the real source and its image sources for an example of one wall and a 2D case with 4 walls. Sound travels at speed $c\\approx340\\frac{m}{s}$ and depending on the position of the image source, the corresponding echo has a certain delay. We will be interested in characterizing the evolution of the density of early reflections. Late reflections are usually characterized as attenuated Gausssian noise."
